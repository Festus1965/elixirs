# elixirs

NOTE: This mod requires my status mod, which can be downloaded from: https://github.com/duane-r/status/archive/master.zip

Elixirs adds bottles of elixir, including some that increase the player's armor and one that allows him to breathe water. I hope to add attack consumables at some point.

All elixirs require a glass bottle and a special ingredient: inspiration (if the inspire mod is available), a slime ball (if slime mobs are available), or a placeholder if neither is available.

Although I don't recommend using this with a standard armor mod, it should cooperate with 3D Armor.
